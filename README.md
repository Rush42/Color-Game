# Color-Game
This app was a small game written for a client in Swift and built in 15 total hours of work. The user matches a word to a button of the same color. The game can get rather confusing with the speed and random colors of the word and background.

The app makes use of In App Purchases as well as video and interstitial iAd advertisements.
