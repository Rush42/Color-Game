# Color Game
A small game demonstrating the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) written for a client in Swift. The user matches a word to a button of the same color. The game can get rather confusing with the speed and random colors of the word and background.

The app makes use of In App Purchases as well as video and interstitial iAd advertisements.
